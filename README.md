\
generated_network_mnist generates a network using NEAT mutations and trains it with backpropogation on MNIST
\
\
mnist_nodes is a fixed size neural network with the backpropogation code tested on MNIST 
\
\
neat_backprop uses NEAT and backpropogation for MNIST 
\
mimicry trains neat + backprop on human joint movement to make a network good at copying a person
\
finetuned mimicry uses ddpg on the generated network from mimicry to finetune
